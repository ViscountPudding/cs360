<h1>Poem</h1>
<p>
I am <b>Incorruptible</b><br>
Rule-maker, the head taker,<br>
A man without error with virtue and terror<br>
As my twin-edged blade, which can't fade<br>
Even while my sharp sword cleaves in spades<br>
The monarchists and their apologists who stirred up my rage,<br>
Opened the cage,<br>
Let revolution take center stage,<br>
Where the only resolution could be blood on the history page.<br>
The loyalists and royalists had better show their respect<br>
To Miss Lunette, who calmly puts her hands on their necks<br>
So Madame Guillotine can finish up and call for the next<br>
Citizen who disgraces that name<br>
This isn't a game, a chance for fortune and fame<br>
The poor-exploitng trash that would put reason to shame,<br>
But rather a hope for the greatest republic for mankind,<br>
Don't get left behind, As<br>
Even former friends can wind up supping in Hades<br>
With Antoinette and here ladies. There will be<br>
No flip-flopping, I'm not stopping<br>
The drop of the blade, chopping<br>
Through the necks of my enemies,<br>
Those who would try to concot cruel conspiracy<br>
Those who would foolishly try to fight liberty<br>
End up the targets of Freedom's true tyranny<br>
